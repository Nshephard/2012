Nick Shephard's Programming Assignment 2 for CPTS 223 Spring 2011.

Creates a console display of BST based on input files.

To run simply open solution and run without debugging (ctrl+f5).
NOTE: 2 current input files. The current loaded input file is "input.txt" which contains the
exact order and information supplied in the example (assignment handout). The "input2.txt"
contains test data for larger elements/trees/number of trees to test code. If you wish to
change input files, just type the file you want to read from in the ifstream line located
at the beginning of the main.cpp file. Thanks!
