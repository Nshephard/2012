Hi! Nick Shephard's project 4 for CPTS 223 Spring 2011. 

I have completed the random maze generation as well as the generating a maze from a file. I made a disjoint set
class of rooms (another sub class), and because i didn't use ints had difficulting implementing the DFS / BFS and was unable
to complete that, but it is commented out within the maze.h header and functions if you wish to check my progress on these searches. Thanks.

To run simply start build without debugging (ctrl f5). Thanks!
